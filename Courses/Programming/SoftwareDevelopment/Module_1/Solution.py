This will act as your 'assignment' for the first module.

Once you complete this, look at the solution in 'sol.py'!

# Assign an integer of 7 to the variable 'x':
x = 7

# Assign an integer of 10 to the variable 'y':
y = 10 


# Add those two values together and set the sum to a variable 'z':
z = x + y

'''
Check if 'z' is less than 20.
    - If it is, then print out saying "The number is small"
    - If it is not, then print out saying "The number is quite large"
'''

if z < 20:
    print("The number is small")
else:
    print("The number is quite large")

# Set a string to say "python is really cool" with the variable name 'first_string':
first_string = "python is really cool"

# Set a boolean value to true for a variable 'learning':
learning = True

'''
Check if 'learning' is less than True:
    - If it is, then print out saying "I'm learning something"
    - If it is not, then print out saying "I'm not learning anything"
'''

# In the future... you can also just do ->>> if learning:
if learning == True:
    print("I'm learning something")
else:
    print("I'm not learning anything")

# Kudos to anyone who **actually did this**
