# About the Courses

The study of Computer Science falls into two differnet buckets; Math and Programming.

An example of how the two interact is Data Structures and Algorithms (The Foundation of almost all SWE interviews). You need to know how to measure the efficiency of algos and math helps..... some...... and by some all you really need to know are logarithms. The other benefit of theoretical math being included in a Computer Science curriculum is the beginning of the development of a framework of thought in order to approach an issue. The approach for that of a proof does not differ too far from that of a 'Story' that you would receive in a Software Engineering role:
1. How do I translate business requirements (== problem requirements for a proof) into code
2. How do I make that code 'readable' (How do I translate a math or CS concept into a proper application of the concept)?
3. How do I organize the story?
etc.
