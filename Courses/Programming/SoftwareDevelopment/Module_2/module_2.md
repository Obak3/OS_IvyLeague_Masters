# Module 2
This is the continuation of the first module! That's an obvious statement, but we're going to expand a little on some of the things that were introduced and make a little bit more sense about how you write actual programs instead of just basic statements.

## Lists in Python!
We introduced Lists back in Module 1, but we truly need to emphasize the importance of them. As a quick refresher, Lists are one of the ways of representing a collection of items in Python. They're often referred to as Arrays in other languages, but we'll walk through why they're so vital to programming.

### Examples of Lists
```Python
# A list as a collection of items for a grocery run
grocery_list = ["Apples", "Bananas", "Oatmeal", "Eggs", "Bread"]

# A list of integers that represent ages of friends
friend_ages = [18, 19, 21, 20, 22]


```
