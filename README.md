# OS_IvyLeague_Masters
This is the best way that I can give back right now, this is all of the materials that I have covered so far in the first semester at my Master's designed for people with no formal background in Computer Science. My undergraduate degree is not in Computer Science and I wanted a stronger foundation to build the next steps of my career off of, so here we are.

## Courses *so far.....*
1. Introduction to Software Development
2. Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science


### Organization
This is how you can find the pertinent resources for the classes in question and some of the justification for why you should learn these things

1. Course Name (Brings you to that directory within the repo.)
2. README for the course in question
