'''
This will act as your 'assignment' for the first module. 

Once you complete this, look at the solution in 'sol.py'!
'''

# Assign an integer of 7 to the variable 'x':


# Assign an integer of 10 to the variable 'y':


# Add those two values together and set the sum to a variable 'z':


'''
Check if 'z' is less than 20.
    - If it is, then print out saying "The number is small"
    - If it is not, then print out saying "The number is quite large"
'''


# Set a string to say "python is really cool" with the variable name 'first_string':


# Set a boolean value to true for a variable 'learning':


'''
Check if 'learning' is less than True:
    - If it is, then print out saying "I'm learning something"
    - If it is not, then print out saying "I'm not learning anything"
''' 



# And that's the end of the first assignment!
