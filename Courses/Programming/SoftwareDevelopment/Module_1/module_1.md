# Module 1: The Introduction
This is going to be all about demistifying what programming is, why everyone wants to do it so badly, and why the hell devs make so much money at some companies (it's hard... but manageable!!!)

## Programming
According to Charles Isbell, the Dean of the College at Computing for Georgia Institute of Technology, programming can be broken down into three things:

## Variables and Storing Data
Most people know variables from basic algebra, where 'x' is associated with an integer, but in programming, your scope and perspective has to change a little bit. Think of a variable as a way of storing a value, but that value can be of several different data types. 

Data Types (Just some, when we get to Java, we'll expand a little more):
1. Integer (Ex: 5 or 7)
	1. A whole number representation of a value
2. String (Ex: "Programming" or "GitHub")
	1. String of characters enclosed by Quotations (or single quotes in Python)
3. Float (Ex: 3.76 or 4.20)
	1. Value that can contain 
4. List (also an Array.... Ex: [1, 2, 3, 4] or ["haha", "joke", "was", "funny"])
5. Boolean (Ex: True or False)
